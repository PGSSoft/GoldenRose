# Development

Run `bundle exec rake install` to install this gem onto your local machine. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, next push git commits and tags, and as the last step push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
